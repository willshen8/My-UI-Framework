# My-UI-Framework

This project started with the inspiration of having my own CSS components library. 
The library enable fast deployment of web apps and sites by using existing components. 

I started the project with HTML and CSS only, and after learning about React.JS I believe
it would be best to be done using React.JS and Redux.
